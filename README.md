# Clone App from Github Plugin

## Function
A command plugin for BladeRunnerJS which clones a github repository with options to download and unzip the .zip file (-zip) and also to checkout a named branch (-b).

## Future
- Needs more tests, especially specTests
- The service loader file needs to be written into since I can't seem to configure it to actually load into brjs
